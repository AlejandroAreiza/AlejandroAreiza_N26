# PetStore API Test Automation Framework - Docker Compose Usage

This document explains how to use Docker Compose to run the PetStore API Test Automation Framework containerized with all dependencies.

---

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine  
  [Get Docker here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)  
- Docker Compose installed (usually included with Docker Desktop)  
- Basic knowledge of terminal/command line usage  

---

## Setup

- Create a folder (e.g src) and give it permission in Docker (Ensure your local folders have appropriate permissions if mounting volumes)
  - Navigate to Settings > Resources > File sharing > Add Folder
- Clone the repository in the folder created:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlejandroAreiza/AlejandroAreiza_N26.git
cd AlejandroAreiza_N26/PetStore.ApiTAF


```

---

## Running Tests with Docker Compose

### Start the test environment, dependencies and run tests:

```bash
docker-compose up -d 
```

This command will:

- Build the Docker image(s) if not already built  
- Start the container(s) running the test automation framework  
- Execute tests automatically as defined in the container entrypoint  

---

## Running Tests by Passing Parameters to Docker Compose

You can customize test execution by passing environment variables to Docker Compose.

#### Common Parameters:

| Variable Name         | Description                                             | Default Value
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `TEST_PROJECT`         | Test project name to execute                            | `pet`                          
| `TEST_FILTER`          | NUnit test filter expression (e.g., Name~TestName) |     `"Category=Regression"` 


#### Example: Running only sanity tests

```bash
docker-compose up -d petstore-api allure
docker-compose run --rm \
  -e TEST_PROJECT=pet \
  -e TEST_FILTER="Name~GivenValidPetId_WhenDeletingPet_ShouldReturnsSuccess" \
  petstore-api-taf
```
This command will:

- Build the Docker image(s) if not already built  
- Start the container(s) petstore api and allure 
- Execute tests automatically as defined by the params

## Viewing allure Reports

Once test are been executed go to [Allure Report Page](http://localhost:5050/allure-docker-service/projects/default/reports/latest/index.html?redirect=false) 

---

## Stopping and Cleaning Up

To stop running containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To remove all containers, networks, and volumes created by Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Docker permission issues:** Ensure Docker has permissions to access your local folders if you use volume mounts.  
- **Port conflicts:** If your test framework exposes ports, make sure they are free or change the mapped ports in `docker-compose.yml`.  
- **Logs:** Use `docker-compose logs -f` to view live logs from the test containers.
